 <div>One Monday morning, while the children were enjoying “free play”, I stepped to the doorway of the classroom to take a break. Suddenly, I 1 a movement of the heavy wooden door. This was the very door I 2 guided the children through to ensure their safety from the bitter cold. I felt a chill (寒意) go through my body.</div>
 <div>My legs carried me to that door, and I pushed it open. It was one of my kindergarteners who I thought was 3 that day. He had been dropped off at school late and was 4 to open the door.</div>
 <div>He must have been waiting there for quite a while! Without a word, I rushed him to the hospital. He was treated for frostbite on his hands. He’d need time to 5 , and wouldn’t come for class the next day, I thought.</div>
 <div>The next morning, one of the first to 6 was my little frostbitten boy. Not only did he run in with energy, but his 7 could be heard as loud as ever! I gave him a warm hug and told him how 8 I was to see him. His words have stayed with me all these years, “I knew you would open the door.”</div>
 <div>That cold Monday morning, he waited a long, long while for adults to 9 . To a child, every minute feels like forever. He didn’t attempt to walk back home; he waited and trusted. This five-year-old taught me a powerful lesson in 10 .</div>

 <div>A</div>
 <div>Helen was walking down the street late 11 the evening, her arms filled with grocery bags. Focused on balancing the bags, she didn’t notice her wallet falling out of her pocket. As Helen walked on, she heard a man charging towards her. Fearful that he might have an intention 12 (harm) her, Helen started to run. Eventually, the man 13 (catch) up with her, and he was only trying to return her wallet!</div>
 <div>B</div>
 <div>Why do humans prefer some smells over others? One theory, increasingly 14 (support) by experts, suggests that smell preferences are learned. It’s easy to explain how we determine 15 smells are dangerous or not: we learn. This has been adopted to ensure easier detection of gas leaks. Gas naturally 16 (have) no recognisable smell. However, a strong smell is added so that we can raise the alarm when we detect the smell associated with danger.</div>
 <div>C</div>
 <div>Since people can’t always eat out or cook for 17 (they), they get takeout or order delivery. More takeout and more food delivery equal more waste, especially plastic waste. That includes cups, bottles, and bags, most of 18 are only good for one use. That’s a big problem and it is getting even 19 (bad).

 <div>Peer（同伴）Assisted Study Sessions（PASS）is a peer-facilitated learning programme available to students enrolled（注册）in most core units of study in our business school．</div>
 <div>PASS involves weekly sessions where you work in groups to tackle specially prepared problem sets, based around a unit of study you’re enrolled in.</div>
 <div>PASS doesn’t re-teach or deliver new content. It’s an opportunity to deepen your understanding of the key points from lecture materials while you are applying your skills to solve problems.</div>
 <div>You work interactively with your peers. As a peer group, you decide what is covered in each session. That way, PASS directly responds to your needs and feedback.</div>
 <div>Registration in Term 2 will open at 9 am, 21 September 2022.</div>
 <div>Waiting lists</div>
 <div>If a session is full, you can register for the waiting list. We will email you if a place becomes available or if a new session is to be held.</div>
 <div>When you are placed on a waiting list, we will email you a number which tells you where you are on the list. If you are close to the front of the list, you have a good chance of gaining a place in the programme in the near future.</div>
 <div>Deregistering</div>
 <div>If you miss two PASS sessions in a row, you will be deregistered and your place will be given to someone on the waiting list. Make sure you fill in the attendance sheet at each session to record your attendance.</div>
 <div>You’ll be informed by email if you are being deregistered as a result of missing sessions. If you believe you have received the email in error, email the PASS office at <a href="mailto:passoffice@umbs.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="display: inline-block">passoffice@umbs.edu</a>.</div>

 <div>My name is Alice. Early last year, I was troubled by an anxiety that crippled（削弱）my ability to do anything. I felt like a storm cloud hung over me. For almost a year I struggled on, constantly staring at this wall that faced me. My perfectionist tendencies were the main root of this: I wanted to be perfect at whatever I did, which obviously in life is not possible, but it consumed me.</div>
 <div>One day, I attended a presentation by wildlife conservationist Grant Brown at my high school. His presentation</div>
 <div>not only awed and inspired me，but also helped emerge an inner desire to make a difference in the world．I joined a pre－presentation dinner with him and that smaller setting allowed me to slowly build up my courage to speak one－on－one with him－an idea that had seemed completely impossible．This first contact was where my story began．</div>
 <div>A month later，Brown invited me to attend the World Youth Wildlife Conference．Looking back，I now see that this would be the first in a series of timely opportunities that my old self would have let pass，but that this new and more confident Alice enthusiastically seized．Shortly after I received his invitation，applications to join the Youth for Nature and the Youth for Planet groups were sent around through my high school．I decided to commit to completing the applications，and soon I was a part of a growing global team of young people working to protect nature．Each of these new steps continued to grow my confidence．</div>
 <div>I am writing this just six months since my journey began and I＇ve realised that my biggest obstacle（障碍）this whole time was myself．It was that voice in the back of my head telling me that one phrase that has stopped so many people from reaching their potential：I can＇t．They say good things come to those who wait；I say：grab every opportunity with everything you have and be impatient．After all，nature does not require our patience，but our action．</div>
 <div>24．What was the main cause for Alice＇s anxiety？</div>
 <div>A．Her inability to act her age．</div>
 <div>B．Her habit of consumption．</div>

 <div>＂What would the world be if there were no hunger？＂It＇s a question that Professor Crystal would ask her students． They found it hard to answer，she wrote later，because imagining something that isn＇t part of real life－and learning how to make it real－is a rare skill．It is taught to artists and engineers，but much less often to scientists．Crystal set out to change that，and helped to create a global movement．The result－an approach known as systems thinking－is now seen as essential in meeting global challenges．</div>
 <div>Systems thinking is crucial to achieving targets such as zero hunger and better nutrition because it requires considering the way in which food is produced, processed, delivered and consumed, and looking at how those things intersect（交叉）with human health, the environment, economics and society. According to systems thinking, changing the food system-or any other network-require three things to happen. First, researchers need to identify all the players in that system; second, they must work out how they relate to each other; and third, they need to understand and quantify the impact of those relationships on each other and on those outside the system.</div>
 <div>Take nutrition. In the latest UN report on global food security, the number of undernourished（营养不良）people in the world has been rising, despite great advances in nutrition science. Tracking of 150 biochemicals in food has been important in revealing the relationships between calories, sugar, fat and the occurrence of common diseases. But using machine learning and artificial intelligence, some scientists propose that human diets consist of at least 26,000 biochemicals-and that the vast majority are not known.</div>
 <div>A systems approach to creating change is also built on the assumption that everyone in the system has equal power. But as some researchers find, the food system is not an equal one. A good way to redress（修正）such power imbalance is for more universities to do what Crystal did and teach students how to think using a systems approach.</div>
 <div>More researchers, policymakers and representatives from the food industry must learn to look beyond their direct lines of responsibility and adopt a systems approach. Crystal knew that visions alone don’t produce results, but concluded that “we’ll never produce results that we can’t envision”.</div>

 <div>Quantum（量子）computers have been on my mind a lot lately．A friend has been sending me articles on how quantum computers might help solve some of the biggest challenges we face as humans．I’ve also had exchanges with two quantum－computing experts．One is computer scientist Chris Johnson who I see as someone who helps keep the field honest．The other is physicist Philip Taylor．</div>
 <div>For decades，quantum computing has been little more than a laboratory curiosity．Now，big tech companies have invested in quantum computing，as have many smaller ones．According to Business Weekly，quantum machines could help us＂cure cancer，and even take steps to turn climate change in the opposite direction．＂This is the sort of hype （炒作）that annoys Johnson．He worries that researchers are making promises they can＇t keep．＂What＇s new，＂ Johnson wrote，＂is that millions of dollars are now potentially available to quantum computing researchers．＂</div>
 <div>As quantum computing attracts more attention and funding，researchers may mislead investors，journalists，the public and，worst of all，themselves about their work＇s potential．If researchers can＇t keep their promises，excitement might give way to doubt，disappointment and anger，Johnson warns．Lots of other technologies have gone through stages of excitement．But something about quantum computing makes it especially prone to hype，Johnson suggests， perhaps because＂＇quantum＇stands for something cool you shouldn＇t be able to understand．＂And that brings me back to Taylor，who suggested that I read his book <span class="math-inline " data-overflow="visible"> <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: -0.439ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.79ex" height="2.032ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -704 791 898"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mi"><path data-c="1D444" d="M399 -80Q399 -47 400 -30T402 -11V-7L387 -11Q341 -22 303 -22Q208 -22 138 35T51 201Q50 209 50 244Q50 346 98 438T227 601Q351 704 476 704Q514 704 524 703Q621 689 680 617T740 435Q740 255 592 107Q529 47 461 16L444 8V3Q444 2 449 -24T470 -66T516 -82Q551 -82 583 -60T625 -3Q631 11 638 11Q647 11 649 2Q649 -6 639 -34T611 -100T557 -165T481 -194Q399 -194 399 -87V-80ZM636 468Q636 523 621 564T580 625T530 655T477 665Q429 665 379 640Q277 591 215 464T153 216Q153 110 207 59Q231 38 236 38V46Q236 86 269 120T347 155Q372 155 390 144T417 114T429 82T435 55L448 64Q512 108 557 185T619 334T636 468ZM314 18Q362 18 404 39L403 49Q399 104 366 115Q354 117 347 117Q344 117 341 117T337 118Q317 118 296 98T274 52Q274 18 314 18Z"></path></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container></span> for Quantum．</div>
 <div>After I read the book，Taylor patiently answered my questions about it．He also answered my questions about PyQuantum，the firm he co－founded in 2016．Taylor shares Johnson＇s concerns about hype，but he says those concerns do not apply to PyQuantum．</div>
 <div>The company，he says，is closer than any other firm＂by a very large margin（幅度）＂to building a＂useful＂ quantum computer，one that＂solves an impactful problem that we would not have been able to solve otherwise．＂He adds，＂People will naturally discount my opinions，but I have spent a lot of time quantitatively comparing what we are doing with others．＂</div>
 <div>Could PyQuantum really be leading all the competition＂by a wide margin＂，as Taylor claims？I don＇t know．I＇m certainly not going to advise my friend or anyone else to invest in quantum computers．But I trust Taylor，just as I trust Johnson．</div>
 <div>31．Regarding Johnson＇s concerns，the author feels <span class="math-inline "> <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="4.525ex" height="0.036ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 2000 16"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mstyle"><g data-mml-node="mspace"></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container></span> ．</div>

 <div>Tom，a 15-year-old inventor and entrepreneur（创业者），witnessed at his own school the widespread consumption of sugary drinks by kids．He knew there had to be a better portable drink solution and decided to innovate from something he saw in his own home：fruit infused（浸泡）water．</div>
 <div>Tom watched his mum make healthy fruit infusions but then struggle for a take-along option．From observing his mum and from his desire to give kids better drink options，he came up with his original model for the Fun Bottle．＂I wanted to come up with a healthy，natural way for people to drink when on the go．A big part of my mission is to get people of all ages off sugary drinks，＂Tom explains．</div>
 <div>The bottle is made with a strainer（滤网）that allows the great tastes and natural sugars of the various fruits and vegetables you choose to come through the water，without any of the seeds or skins flowing through．</div>
 <div>Tom is proud of his design and excited to be selling the Fun Bottle on his website and in stores，but this 15-year-old is most proud of the opportunities that Fun Bottle presents to others．It helps to provide healthy alternatives to sugary drinks；and also Tom donates part of the profits to the Organisation for a Healthier Generation （OHG）．</div>
 <div>Tom has been awarded several prizes，but this teenage innovator remains humble．When asked what advice he＇d give other entrepreneurial youth，he says，＂Prepare and have your family＇s support．It is important to know from the beginning that there are a lot of highs and lows，and there is no such thing as overnight success．＂</div>
 <div>40．What did Tom witness at his own school？</div>
 <div>41．Where did Tom get the idea for the original model for the Fun Bottle？</div>
