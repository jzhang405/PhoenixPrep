The survivors had to take up the work. For me and my co-workers, this meant no lunch hour. I wanted to quit, but given the economy, it was hard to find another job.

 <div>I was four when Dad first showed me how to skim stones, a game in which one throws smooth flat stones into a river to make them jump across the surface. I’d pass hours on beaches with my brother, picking up muddy stones and skimming them. It was satisfying making them dance on the surface.

I enjoyed javelin (标枪) and was on a baseball team, but skimming stones was just for fun.</div>

 <div>I returned to the 2018 championship, hoping for a champion. Walking on to the small throwing platform in my trainers, I threw a decent 44 metres and won. I spotted someone wearing a competition sweater with “World” written across it. “Where’s that?” I asked and he told me about the annual World Stone Skimming Championships in Scotland.</div>
 <div>It was a month away and a six-hour drive. I thought about the cost and distance for weeks until, the day before the contest, the feeling of winning made a decision for me. “I’m going.” I arrived at a hotel at 10 pm, but couldn’t sleep for nerves and excitement. Early the next morning, I drove to the crossing where the competitors had begun waiting. Ropes and buoys (浮标) marked a 63-metre course. I had no idea if my best score was good enough to win. When my name was called at the prize-giving ceremony that afternoon, I was overjoyed. I was the women’s world champion.</div>
 <div>I’m a big believer in giving things a go. I’m 42, and to become a world champion at this stage is pretty left-field. It showed me it was worth jumping in the car that day-and proof that a childhood spent throwing muddy stones from beaches wasn’t wasted.</div>

 <div>Clown fish live their adult lives in the protective arms of sea anemones, the small brightly colored sea animals attached onto rocks to house clown fish. Between birth and adulthood, however, the fish have to complete a treacherous journey. After hatching, they swim out to the open sea to finish developing. After maturing, the young fish swim back, during which they have to avoid a “wall of mouths” by sensing the unfriendly smells. With ocean acidification, a trend that is occurring worldwide, scientists began to wonder what might happen to fish’s sense of smell.</div>
 <div>My team put 300 recently hatched clown fish in our lab. When we introduced a friendly fish odor (气味), they did not react. But when we introduced an enemy odor, they swam away. We then repeated the experiment with 300 new hatchlings from the same parents in the more acidic water-a level we can expect by the year 2100 if current trends continue. When we introduced friendly and unfriendly smells at the same time, the fish seemed unable to make up their minds, spending equal time swimming toward one smell and the other. They could sense chemical signals but couldn’t recognize the meaning of them.</div>
 <div>It is always tricky to say that behaviors seen in a lab would also be seen in the wild. So we went to a sandy lake near one of the Great Barrier Reef’s northern islands to test how wild-caught damselfish would react to enemy smells after exposing them to acidic water. In a tank, about half of them held in water with acidity expected by 2050 were attracted to the unfriendly odor and half were not, yet not one held in water anticipated by 2100 avoided being attracted to the enemy odor. We then let the marked damselfish loose in the lake. The fish once held in the most acidic water swam farther away from their protective home.</div>

 <div>Can fish adapt? Most studies have habituated fish to lifted acidic conditions over a few days or months-an extremely short length of time. The animals are not given a realistic opportunity to adapt. Yet some scientists thought that fish might escape the anger of ocean acidification, in part because early research done in the 1980s showed that certain animals had an astonishing ability to regulate their internal chemistry to survive acidified water. But maintaining normal functions such as avoiding danger is a different challenge.</div>
 <div>At a minimum, confusion could place yet another stressor on fish already challenged by rising water temperatures, overfishing, etc. Further, if many ocean creatures start to behave strangely, entire food webs and ecosystems could come crashing down. Although the science is still new, the results appear to be lining up: ocean acidification is messing with fish’s minds.</div>

 <div>In the past 60 years, something strange has happened. As the academic study of creativity has thrived（蓬勃发展），the label innovation may have covered every tiny change of a soda can or a toothpaste flavor, but the rate of productivity growth has been mostly declining since the 1970s. John Fernald, an economist, points out that the notable exception to the post-1970 decline in productivity occurred when businesses throughout the economy finally figured out the breakthrough technology - information technology. John Fernald says, “It’s possible that productivity took off, because we picked all the low-hanging fruit from the IT wave.” Actually, the world economy continues to harvest the benefits of IT. But where will the next technology shock come from?</div>
 <div>Breakthrough technology results from two distinct activities-invention and innovation. Invention is typically the work of scientists and researchers in labs, while innovation is an invention put to commercial use. Seldom do the two activities occur successfully under the same roof. They tend to thrive in opposite conditions; while competition and consumer choice encourage innovation, invention has historically progressed in labs that are protected from the pressure to generate profit.</div>
 <div>Allowing well-funded and diverse teams to try to solve big problems is what gave us the computer and the Internet. Today, we fail to give attention to planting the seeds of this kind of ambitious research, while complaining about the harvest. “Companies are really good at combining existing breakthroughs in ways that consumers like. But the breakthroughs come from patient and curious scientists, not the rush to market,” says Jon Gertner, the author of The Idea Factory.</div>
 <div>“Technology is a tall tree,” John Fernald said. “But planting the seeds of invention and harvesting the fruit of innovation are entirely distinct skills, often mastered by different organizations and separated by many years.” As for me, both of them are essential for technology, although they are relatively independent. I don’t think X is a planter or a harvester, actually. It is like building taller ladders. Nobody knows for sure what, if anything, the employees at such enterprises are going to find up on those ladders. But they’re reaching. At least someone is.</div>
 <ol start="31"> <li>What is the main purpose of the first two paragraphs?</li> </ol> <div>A. To present the process of group discussion.</div>
 <div>B. To illustrate X’s worry about big problems.</div>
 <div>C. To reveal the importance of the crazy ideas.</div>
 <div>D. To stress the varied backgrounds of the team.</div>
 <ol start="32"> <li>What can we learn from the passage?</li> </ol> <div>A. Breakthroughs must stand the test of the market.</div>

 <div>Once upon a time，we were all question－asking experts．We started asking our parents numerous questions as kids．By preschool，our inquiries even reached the depths of science， philosophy，and the social order．Where does the sun go at night？Why doesn＇t that man have a home like we do？Why do rocks sink but ice floats？35</div>
 <div>Why does the child＇s urge to ask questions grow inactive in so many adults？An important factor is how the social environments surrounding us change as we age．Schools transform from a place for asking questions to one funded by our ability to answer them．36 And we recognize that society rewards the people who propose to have the answers．</div>
 <div>37 We can be braver about asking questions in public and encouraging others to pursue their curiosity，too．In that encouragement，we help create an environment where those around us feel safe to ask questions．</div>
 <div>When it comes to how we phrase questions，we are advised to open with less sensitive questions，favor follow－up questions，and keep questions open－ended．We can also practice asking questions of and for ourselves by keeping a running list of questions in a journal．38 Finally， we could set aside time to ask absurd questions like＂How would you accomplish a week＇s work in two hours？＂This type of questions forces us to break the boundaries of our comfort zone．</div>
 <div>In the world that does not look much as it did years ago，we must ask questions．39 Great questions can open up our capacity to change because they allow us to draw people in， opening them up to sharing knowledge，ideas，and opinions．And they are also our primary means of learning about the world．In short，asking questions is the best way to deepen our understanding of the things that matter to our life．As any child could probably tell us if we asked．</div>
 <div>A．Then，at some point，our inquiring desires disappear．</div>
 <div>B．It is a high－payoff behavior especially in times of change．</div>
 <div>C．The questions we ask depend on our attitudes as well as the situations．</div>
 <div>D．But as we grow up，asking questions fills us with worry and self－doubt．</div>
 <div>E．As such，one way to renew our inquiring spirit is to change the atmosphere．</div>
 <div>F．We learn to sell ourselves on the job market by what we know，not what we don＇t．</div>
 <div>G．It not only removes the publicity from question asking，but offers us a place to experiment．</div>

 <div>Over the years I have been fascinated to read about studies into the power of touch.</div>
 <div>One famous study examined videos of how people responded to those near them who had been the victim of a bad fortune. Researchers looked at their interaction with the victim, and compared this with behaviours in non-human primates（灵长类动物）。It found that humans and primates comfort one another and demonstrate care in a similar way. It makes sense for me that offering hugs to calm victims may be an instinct that we got from primate ancestors.</div>
 <div>Another study found that when the husband or wife of a patient in sorrow or discomfort reaches out and holds their hand and, as if by magic, they become settled and less sorrowful. Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised, as we have known for many years about the importance of touch. It symbolises safety and love, and this is actually one of the most important aspects for development as a child. Is it any wonder that, when we are upset and distressed as adults, we seek out the same things? Whether young or old, humans are wired to be touched.</div>
 <div>Nevertheless, many people today suffer from “touch hunger”, which typically occurs when a person experiences little touch or contact for a long time. It serves as a warning that the sense of security and care that comes with the contact of touch is missing. Thus, their well-being can suffer. It is associated with greater stress, anxiety and loneliness, and lower-quality sleep.</div>
 <div>Actually, even the briefest touch from us can bring strong emotional experiences to the receivers who suffer from “touch hunger”. A warm handshake, a gentle pat on the shoulder, or a high-five is often enough to convey love and care.</div>
 <div>Be a giver!</div>
 <ol start="40"> <li> <div>What did the first study find about touch?</div>
 </li> <li> <div>Why is touch important?</div>
 </li> <li> <div>Please decide which part is false in the following statement, then underline it and explain why.</div>
 </li> </ol> <div>Touch has the great power to give people who suffer from “touch hunger” strong emotional experiences, but a brief touch like a handshake is too light to convey love and care.</div>
 <ol start="43"> <li>Apart from touch, what other way(s) do you often use to express your love and care in your 1? (In about 40 words)</li> </ol> <div>第二节（20 分）</div>

 <div>Dear Jim,</div>
 <div>How is it going? We plan to form a research-based learning group. I wonder whether you would like to join us.</div>
 <div>Our topic is “A Study on the Differences between British English and American English”. We mainly focus on their differences in terms of spelling, pronunciation and vocabulary. The aim is to make us familiar with the underlying causes and effects of the differences so that we can gain a better understanding of the English language.</div>
 <div>I know you are a native speaker of British English and you lived in America for several years, so hopefully you can give us some guidance during the research process. Please inform me of your decision by this Friday.</div>
 <div>Your involvement will add much joy to our group. Looking forward to your reply.</div>
 <div>Yours,</div>
 <div>Li Hua</div>

 <div>Dear Jim,</div>
 <div>As you know, we are required to do research-based learning this term. I am writing to invite you to join my team.</div>
 <div>Here is the detailed information. We intend to compare Chinese literature and English literature in the same historical period, for example, Shakespeare and Tang Xianzu of the Ming Dynasty. Since there was little chance for pure literary exchange between nations in history, what we are doing can help great writers from China and Britain talk spiritually to some extent.</div>
 <div>I want you in because I know you have a great passion for British literature. Your professional knowledge will surely help us in efficiency and accuracy. Also, just imagine the sense of awe you may get from the similarities and differences we will find. If you are interested, let me know before next Friday.</div>
 <div>Looking forward to your reply!</div>
 <div>Yours,</div>
 <div>Li Hua</div>

 <div>Dear Jim,</div>
 <div>I’m establishing a research-based learning team on English study. I wonder if you would like to be a member of it.</div>
 <div>I plan to study how to improve our English ability by watching English movies. Ten classic English movies like Forrest Gump will be covered. We will analyse the authentic expressions and native pronunciations, and discuss how to apply them to English study. As watching English movies offers an easy access to English learning, this project will give students a clue about enjoyable and practical learning methods.</div>
 <div>Knowing you have conducted relevant research, I think my project may feed your interest from a different angle. Moreover, I’m sure your participation will increase the efficiency of completing tasks. If you’d like to come, please let me know before next Friday.</div>
 <div>I sincerely hope that we can work together on this project.</div>
 <div>Yours,</div>
