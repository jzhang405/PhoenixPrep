 <div>My son was born with breathing difficulties, so he had to stay in NICU, the hospital unit for newborns needing intensive care. There he could only be fed through a tube. I hated the tube. The lovely dreams I had of nursing my baby were entirely <span class="math-inline "> <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="4.525ex" height="0.036ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 2000 16"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mstyle"><g data-mml-node="mspace"></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container></span> .</div>

After eighteen hours, it was determined he could not do that and the tube was back. This meant he wasn’t getting stronger.

 <div>Seated outside the NICU, I started crying. Just then, a young nurse came and sat beside me. When I had <span class="math-inline "> <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="4.525ex" height="0.036ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 2000 16"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mstyle"><g data-mml-node="mspace"></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container></span> my sorrow a little, she handed me a tissue and asked if I wanted to talk. I asked again if we could remove the tube.</div>
 <div>The nurse replied, “Not today. But remember, tomorrow is a new day.”</div>
 <div>She seemed much younger than me, but her words were <span class="math-inline "> <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="4.525ex" height="0.036ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 2000 16"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mstyle"><g data-mml-node="mspace"></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container></span> and hope-filled, and I held on to them.

 <div>I lost my leg to cancer at 30. My first trip out of the house as a one-legged woman would be to see a sick friend’in hospital with my mom.</div>
 <div>As I made my way through the hospital, I was prepared for looks of curiosity, sympathy, and even shock. But one thing shook me to a depth I had never experienced before. Two kids were playing in the hallway. As I passed by on my crutches (拐杖), they looked up at me, and suddenly, the little boy pointed at me. “Look at that lady!” It seemed that he was shouting loud enough for the entire hospital to hear. “She only has one leg! Doesn’t that look funny?”</div>
 <div>Both of the kids burst into laughter. Heads turned, and I felt the blood rush to my face. I put my head down and rushed out as fast as I dared on my crutches. I held my tears back until the car door closed. As I fell into the seats, I cried, “How could they think this is funny?”</div>
 <div>My mom tried her best to comfort me, “Honey, they are just kids. They don’t know any better.” They were just kids, but that did not excuse their rude behavior. I felt a wave of belief flood through me. I knew what I had to do. “Well, someone has to teach them!” I said. And I knew that someone would be me.</div>
 <div>When I was well enough, I started to visit elementary schools and talk to children about being different. I was teaching children to be respectful of people who are different, and teaching them people come in all shapes, colors and sizes and we are each special and unique.</div>
 <div>Speaking to children was just the beginning for me. I became an inspirational speaker and author and learned that being grateful for all the remaining parts of me was the only way to start and end my day. I shared my story in my book called I Am Choosing to Smile. I do, indeed, choose to smile. Waking up every morning, I look down at my one foot and say with all sincerity, “Good morning, five toes. I’m very glad to see you!”</div>

 <div>Researchers from a U.K. plant research institute have found a way to provide plants with an antibody-based defense for a specific threat, potentially speeding the creation of crops resistant to any kind of emerging virus, or bacterium (细菌). The strategy is to inoculate a protein from the plant pathogen (病原体) to be targeted to a camel or other camel relatives, purify the unusually small antibodies the camels produce, and engineer the corresponding gene section for them into a plant’s own immune gene.</div>
 <div>Farmers lose many billions of dollars to plant diseases each year, and emerging pathogens pose new threats to food security in the developing world. Plants have evolved their own immune system, kick-started by cell receptors that recognize general pathogen features, such as a bacterial cell wall, as well as intracellular receptors for molecules (分子) produced by specific pathogens. If a plant cell detects these molecules, it may trigger its own death to save the rest of the plant. But plant pathogens often evolve and escape from those receptors.</div>
 <div>A long-standing dream in plant biotechnology is to create designer disease resistance genes that could be produced as fast as pathogens emerge. One approach is to edit the gene for a plant immune receptor, changing the protein’s shape to recognize a particular pathogenic molecule.</div>
 <div>Instead, Sophien Kamoun, a molecular biologist at the Sainsbury Laboratory, and his colleagues used an animal immune system to help make the receptor adjustments. During an infection with a new pathogen, animals produce billions of slightly different antibodies, ultimately selecting and mass-producing those that best target the virus.</div>
 <div>Camelids, which include camels, are workhorses for antibody design because their immune systems create unusually small versions, called nano-bodies. As a proof of principle of the new plant defense strategy, Kamoun’s group turned to two standard camelid nano-bodies that recognize two different molecules, including one called green fluorescent protein (GFP), to detect test viruses, in this case a potato virus, engineered to make the fluorescent proteins. They investigated how well plants with the nano-body-enhanced receptors detected the changed potato viruses. It was found that the plants increased an active immune response and experienced almost no viral reproduction.</div>
 <div>“The exciting part about this technology is that we have the potential of made-to-order resistance genes and keeping up with a pathogen,” Kamoun says. “This technology is a potential game changer,” says Jeff Dangl, a plant researcher at the University of North Carolina. Ksenia Krasileva, a scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, says the mixture of nano-bodies with plant immune receptors opens up a vast body of biomedical knowledge for plant scientists. “We can now dig into all of that research and translate it to save crops.”</div>

 <div>Superhuman artificial intelligence is already among us. Well, sort of. When it comes to playing games like chess and Go, or solving difficult scientific challenges like predicting protein structures, computers are well ahead of us. But we have one superpower they aren’t close to mastering: mind reading.</div>
 <div>Humans have a mysterious ability to reason the goals, desires and beliefs of others, a crucial skill that means we can anticipate other people’s actions and the consequences of our own. Reading minds comes so easily to us, though, that we often don’t think to spell out what we want. If AIs are to become truly useful in everyday life-to cooperate effectively with us or to understand that a child might run into the road after a bouncing ball-we have to give them this gift that evolution has given us to read other people’s minds.</div>
 <div>Psychologists refer to the ability to infer another’s mental state as theory of mind. In humans, this capacity starts to develop at a very young age. How to reproduce the capability in machines is far from clear, though. One of the main challenges is context. For instance, if someone asks whether you are going for a run and you reply “it’s raining”, they can quickly conclude that the answer is no. But this requires huge amounts of background knowledge about running, weather and human preferences.</div>
 <div>高三英语 第 6 页（共 10 页）</div>
 <div>Moreover, whether humans or AI, the theory of mind is supposed to emerge naturally from one’s own learning process. Building prior knowledge into AI makes it reliant on our imperfect understanding of theory of mind. In addition, AI may be capable of developing approaches we could never imagine. There can be many forms of theory of mind that we don’t know about simply because we live in a human body that has certain types of senses and a certain ability to think.</div>
 <div>Yet we might still want AI to have a more human-like form of theory of mind. Humans can clearly explain their goals and desires to each other using common language and ideas. While letting AI form the theory of mind in their learning process is likely to lead to developing more powerful AI, plainly building in shared ways to represent knowledge may be crucial for humans to trust and communicate with AI.</div>
 <div>It is important to remember, though, that the pursuit of machines with theory of mind is about more than just building more useful robots. It is also a stepping stone on the path towards a deeper goal for AI and robotics research: building truly self-aware machines. Whether we will ever get there remains to be seen. But along the way thinking about other people and other agents, we are on the path to learning to think about ourselves.</div>
 <div>3). According to the passage, which of the following contexts can AI understand well?</div>
 <div>A. When you are asked to eat spicy food for dinner and you reply “a sore throat”.</div>
 <div>B. When a teacher asks for a boy’s homework and he answers “my dog ate it”.</div>
 <div>C. When a mom tells her kid some food is good for health and the kid eats it.</div>

 <div>In our modern world, there are endless alternatives. Have you ever found yourself wondering whether you should quit or stay in your job, accept an offer or give it up for another? There is a simple and practical method that solves this problem. 3 When you understand the concept, you have the power to measure every alternative with precision and make the right decision.</div>
 <div>In the field of economics, opportunity cost is the value that you have to give up when you choose an option over another good option. 3 Do Every time you choose something, you give up other alternatives together with their financial benefits. It is not all the other options, but the most valued one that is defined as the opportunity cost.</div>
 <div>37 Take the simple example of trying to decide whether to take public transportation for 80 minutes or to drive for 40 minutes. You might save on the cost of gas while riding the bus but double the trip length and miss out on other things you could have done during that time. This is how you create priorities in your daily life.</div>
 <div>Though useful in decision making, the biggest drawback of opportunity cost is that it’s often related to what’s hard to quantify. 39 After all, putting a number to your peaceful mind or happiness can be difficult.</div>
 <div>Opportunity cost isn’t cut and dried. It varies from person to person. At the end of the day, you are in charge of what you own and what you want to gain.</div>
 <div>A. It is about finding out the opportunity cost.</div>
 <div>B. Weigh the losses and gains, and make your decision.</div>
 <div>C. Opportunity cost matters not only in economics but also in real life.</div>
 <div>D. This is especially true when the opportunity cost is of non-financial benefit.</div>
 <div>E. The key principle underlying the idea is that there is no such thing as free lunch.</div>
 <div>F. Most people overlook opportunity cost because the benefits are usually hidden from view.</div>
 <div>G. It is the development of important skills that would help you move forward in your daily life.</div>

 <div>The term “nostalgia” was first coined in 1688 and was defined as a mental illness of soldiers continually thinking about their homeland and longing for return. However, today we have a much more positive attitude to nostalgia. It’s a great example of the benefits of a strong memory.</div>
 <div>In numerous scientific experiments, researchers have found that subjects are much more likely to report positive feelings from a given piece of music if they’ve heard it before. But there’s also a growing body of research into time travel “the other way”, because memory skills can take people into the future, too. Decades of studies have shown that time travel into the future can bring a whole new set of rewards. For example, athletes who practice by mentally visualizing and imagining successful performances in the future do perform better.</div>
 <div>All these findings are inspiring and attractive. How could you become a confident time traveler to the past or into the future? Here are some tips for you:</div>
 <ul> <li> <div>To take pleasure in helpful memories, maybe to reawaken happy feelings, use all your senses-not just sight. Smell, taste, touch and sound will also help you to recreate the past in rich clarity.</div>
 </li> <li> <div>If you find a memory that’s particularly helpful-for reassurance, say-keep using it! You’ll get faster at finding it, and add extra layers of detail each time.</div>
 </li> <li> <div>When you’re procrastinating (拖延), visualize an end result. Flash forward to see the floor swept or the essay finished, and use that positive image to drive you into action.</div>
 </li> <li> <div>Ahead of major challenges, imagine the full impact of success. Don’t just picture yourself getting that great job: fill your mind with the really big ways it’s going to change your life.</div>
 </li> </ul> <div>There’ll still be times when old thoughts remind you of sadness, or you’re anxious about what’s next. But the more you learn to control your memory, the better you’ll be at mining your past, and shaping your future, to be your best self now.</div>
 <ol start="40"> <li> <div>What did nostalgia originally mean?</div>
 </li> <li> <div>What have the researchers found about time travel?</div>
 </li> <li> <div>Please decide which part is false in the following statement, then underline it and explain why.</div>
 </li> </ol> <div>Memory skills can bring us into the future, so we should imagine a negative end result to drive us into action when procrastinating.</div>

 <div>第二节（20 分）</div>
 <div>Dear Jim,</div>
 <div>Thank you for your recommendation of the English novel The Old Man and the Sea.</div>
 <div>Having finished reading, I’ve harvested a lot. The tough man who fights against the big fish and sharks alone in the sea inspires me to brave frustrations in my life. And I have learned that we should stick to our dreams no matter what hardships we may encounter.</div>
 <div>The book unfolds a new world to me. Thus, I make a plan for further reading. English novels enlightening my mind will be included in my reading list. I intend to read one book a month. While reading, I will take down my understanding in time to gain more beyond the lines.</div>
 <div>I would appreciate it if you could give me more recommendations.</div>
 <div>Yours,</div>
 <div>Li Hua</div>
