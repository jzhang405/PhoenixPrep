Whatever he desires, he asks his parents to purchase it in a split of seconds.</div>
 <div>“Mom, I want a soccer uniform,” he begged his mother.</div>

His dream seemed to collapse. However, Jerry never gave up his idea. He kept thinking how to achieve it as early as possible. A sparkling idea struck his mind.

 <div>He drew a circle with the help of a bowl and modified the soccer image onto the T-shirt.

 <h2 type="section" data-unnumbered="true" class="section-title" id="give-a-little-sunshine!"> Give a little sunshine!</h2> <div>The Council on Aging (COA)runs a telephone friendship project called the Sunshine Call Program, matching over-60s with a friendly volunteer for a daily chat over the phone.The aim is simple- -to help ease the loneliness and repair social networks. .</div>
 <div>Sheila, 77, a retired teacher, lived alone. She has been receiving calls from Rianne, a volunteer, for over two months.</div>
 <div>“Talking to Rianne is something I really look forward to -a breath of fresh air. We talk about everything-theatre, her work, books we’ve read…Listening to someone else’s life enriches. 20IL and gives you something positive to focus on.”</div>
 <div>“At the beginning, I had no expectation of how the phone calls would go, but it’s wonderful that it’s led to a genuine. friendship Rianne helps me a lot…”</div>
 <div>Are you ready to add a little sunshine to a senior’s life?</div>
 <div>The Sunshine Call Program initially links a volunteer with an isolate（独居的）senior for a daily call When comfortable the volunteer introduces a second senior to the call. Then another, until there are four seniors to one volunteer on what is essentially a conference call. Without having to leave the house, you will help the seniors meet and make new friends. They will then exchange phone numbers to chat on their own and reduce their isolation.</div>
 <div>What are the volunteer qualifications?</div>
 <div>Volunteers must have access to the Internet and be willing to be trained on the use of a chat app. COA will provide all supplies required to make the calls. Besides, volunteers must agree to participate in monthly meetings with other volunteers and guest speakers. All volunteers must be willing to provide a recent Criminal Record Check, the cost of which will be borne by COA. And the most important volunteer qualification is a sense of caring and a desire to help seniors in the community!</div>

 <div>This was the first communication that had come from, her aunt in Jessie’s lifetime.</div>
 <div>“I think your aunt has forgiven me at last,” her father said as he passed the letter across the table.</div>
 <div>Jessie looked first at the autograph（签名）. It seemed strange to see her own name there. There was a likeness between her aunt’s autograph and her own, a hint of the same decisiveness and precision. If Jessie had been educated fifty years earlier, she might have written her name in just that manner.</div>
 <div>“You’re very like her in some ways,” her father said, as she still stared at the autograph.</div>
 <div>“I should think you must almost have forgotten what Aunt Jessie was like, dear,” she said. “How many years is it since you last saw her?”</div>
 <div>“More than forty,” her father said. “We disagreed, We invariably disagreed. Jessie always prided herself on being so modern. She read Darwin and things like that. Altogether beyond me, I admit.”</div>
 <div>“And so it seems that she wants to see me.” Jessie straightened her shoulders and lifted her head, She was excited at the thought of meeting this mythical aunt whom she had so often heard about. Sometimes she had wondered if the personality of this remarkable relative had not been a figment(虚构) of her father’s imagination.</div>
 <div>But this letter of hers that now lay on the breakfast table was admirable in character/There was something of intolerance expressed in its tone. It was just like what her father had told her</div>
 <div>Mr. Deane came out of his past memories with a sigh.</div>
 <div>“Yes, yes; she wants to see you, my dear,” he said. “I’ve heard she has set up a school and helped many youngsters… I think you had better accept this invitation to say with her. If she took a fancy to you, you could get a better education…”</div>
 <div>He sighed again, and Jessie knew tat for the hundredth time he was regretting his own past weakness…</div>
 <ol start="25"> <li>How was the relationship between Jessie’s father and her aunt?</li> </ol> <div>A. It remained very close over the years.</div>
 <div>B. It was broken when they were young.</div>
 <div>C. It got tenser due to a misunderstanding.</div>
 <div>D. It was uneasy for their financial differences.</div>

 <div>C. angry with her aunt for ignoring her family</div>
 <div>D. puzzled by her aunt’s sudden interest in her</div>

 <div>Many people would answer the question of what makes us human by insisting that we are cultural beings. There is no doubt that we are. But one definition of culture is the totality of traditions acquired in a community by social learning from other individuals, and many animal species have traditions. Can we then say that some animals are cultural beings too?</div>
 <div>One approach to study culture in animals is the so-called Method of Exclusion(排除), in which scientists investigate behavioral variations across populations of one species. In a famous study, scientists learned that chimpanzee(黑猩猩) behaviors were socially passed on) as they were present at some sites but not at others, despite having same/ecological settings. For example, chimpanzees in Tai National Park in Ivory Coast are well-know for</div>
 <div>关注北京高考在线官方微信：北京高考资讯（微信号：bjgkzx），获取更多试题资料及排名分析信息。</div>
 <div>their nut-cracking skills. Chimpanzees in Gombe National Park in Tanzania, on the other hand, do not crack nuts, although nuts exist in their environment too.</div>
 <div>However, when applying the Method of Exclusion, one has to be very careful. There are other factors that could also explain the pattern of behavioral variation. For example, some of the chimpanzee techniques scientists evaluated occur in only one of the three subspecies. So it’s quite possible that these behaviors also have an innate component. This would mean that one chimpanzee subspecies uses a new technique not out of cultural tradition, but because the behavior is fixed to specific genes. Another factor that has to be excluded is of course the envirotment Chimpanzees in Mahale do not fish algae（水藻）, simply because algae does not exist there.</div>
 <div>But when we exclude all the variations that can be explained by genes or environment, we still find that animals do show cultural variations. Does that mean there is no real difference between them and us after all? Not exactly. There is a fundamental difference between human and animal culture. Only humans can build culturally on what generations before us have learned. This is called “cumulative culture”. We don’t have to keep reinventing the wheel. This is called the “ratchet（棘轮）effect”. Like a ratchet that can be turned forward but not back, people＇s cultural techniques evolve.</div>
 <div>It is likely that behaviors we see today in chimpanzee cultures could be invented over and over again by individual animals themselves. In contrast, a child born today would not be able to invent a computer without the knowledge of many past generations.</div>
 <ol start="28"> <li>Why does the author mention the example of the chimpanzees in two parks in Paragraph 2?</li> </ol> <div>A. To prove that culture does exist in animals.</div>
 <div>B. To justify the uniqueness of the research method.</div>
 <div>C. To compare how chimpanzees behave in different parks.</div>
 <div>D. To stress the importance of environment in studying culture.</div>
 <ol start="29"> <li>What does the underlined word “innate” in Paragraph 3 probably mean?</li> </ol> <div>A. Advanced.</div>
 <div>B. Inborn.</div>
 <div>C. Adaptive.</div>
 <div>D. Intelligent.</div>
 <ol start="30"> <li>What can we learn from the passage?</li> </ol> <div>A. Cumulative culture is what sets humans apart from animals.</div>
 <div>B. Culture in animals is as worthy to be valued as human culture.</div>
 <div>C. Animals don’t have the ability to invent behaviors in a community.</div>
 <div>D. The “ratchet effect” decides if humans can build on past experiences.</div>

 <div>When Elinor Lobel was 16, a “smart” insulin(胰岛素) pump was attached to her body. Powered by AI, it tracks her glucose levels and administers the right dose of insulin at the right time to keep her healthy. It is one of the new ways that data and AI can help improve lives.</div>
 <div>Books that criticize the dark side of data are plentiful. They generally suggest there is much more to fear than fete in the algorithmic(算法的) age.</div>
 <div>But the intellectual tide may be turning. One of the most persuasive supporters of a more balanced view is Elinor</div>
 <div>Lobel’s mother, Orly, a law professor. In The Equality Machine she acknowledges AI’s capacity to produce harmful results. But she shows how, in the right hands, it can also be used to fight inequality and discrimination.</div>
 <div>A principle of privacy rules is “minimization”: collect and keep as little information as possible, especially in areas such as race and Render. Ms Lobel flips the script, showing how in hiring, pay and the legal system, knowing such characteristics leads to fairer outcomes.</div>
 <div>Ms Lobel’s call to use more, not less, personal information challenges data-privacy orthodoxy(正统观念). But she insists that “tracking difference is key to detecting unfairness.” She advocates a loosening of privacy rules to provide more transparency(透明) over algorithmic decisions.</div>
 <div>The problems with algorithmic formulae(公式) are tackled in depth in Escape from Model Land by Erica Thompson of the School of Economics. These statistical models are the backbone of big data and AI. Yet a perfect model will always be beyond reach. “All models are wrong,” runs a wise saying. “Some are useful.”</div>
 <div>Ms Thompson focuses on a challenge she calls the Hawkmoth Effect. In the better known Butterfly Effect, a serviceable model, in the prediction of climate change, becomes less reliable over time because of the complexity of what it is simulating(模拟), or because of inaccuracies in the original data. In the Hawkmoth Effect, by contrast, the model itself is flawed; it might fail to take full account of the interplay between humidity, wind and temperature.</div>
 <div>The author calls on data geeks to improve their solutions to real-world issues, not merely refine their formulaein other words, to escape from model land. “We do not need to have the best possible answer,” she writes, “only a reasonable one.”</div>
 <div>Both these books exhibit a healthy realism about data, algorithms and their limitations. Both recognize that making progress involves accepting limitations, whether in law or coding. As Ms Lobel puts it: “It’s always better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.”</div>
 <ol start="31"> <li>Ms Lobel intends to convey that</li> </ol> <div>A. minimisation is a good privacy rule to go by</div>
 <div>B. algorithms are currently challenged by data privacy</div>
 <div>C. employing more personal data should be encouraged</div>
 <div>D. identifying algorithms’ problems leads to better outcomes</div>
 <ol start="32"> <li>What can we learn about “Hawkmoth Effect”?</li> </ol> <div>A. It develops from Butterfly Effect.</div>
 <div>B. It emphasizes accuracy of original data.</div>
 <div>C. It enjoys popularity in climate research field.</div>
 <div>D. It is mentioned to show the model can be faulty.</div>

 <div>Expressive writing or journaling is one way to help you heal from trauma（创伤） 35 ．It can help you process what you’ve been through and assist you as you envision a path forward.</div>
 <div>Why does a writing intervention work? 36 In fact, narrating the story of an ongoing anxiety “frees up” cognitive resources. When you write down the emotions associated with a traumatic experience, you may be changing the way it is organized in the brain. You are then able to detach from the emotion, making it easier for you to talk about and process the event.</div>
 <div>However, for most people, the thought of acknowledging emotions and admitting that there’s something wrong with us is difficult This is because expressing emotions can bring up feelings of guilt and shame. 37 ．That is what sets journaling apart. This is between you and your journal- you don’t have to share it with anyone unless, of course, you choose to.</div>
 <div>If you’re interested in trying out writing as a tool for healing, start your writing by setting a timer for ten minutes. 38 Think of one object in your home that signifies a moment for you. See it in full color. Feel the weight of it. Use all your senses. Now, write about that object and see how large its meaning can become.</div>
 <div>39 How you heal from trauma can be different from person to person as well. It all depends on what works best for you. Remember, one size does not fit all. Writing may not work for everyone, but you won’t know if you don’t try.</div>
 <div>A．Despite that, expressive writing remains an accessible tool,</div>
 <div>B Of course, expressive writing is hardly a panacea（灵丹妙药）．</div>
 <div>C．Also, seeking help for emotional stress is often seen as a sign of weakness.</div>
 <div>D．It may seem abnormal that writing about negative experiences has a positive effect．</div>
 <div>E．Once you have a better handle o your problems, you can move forward and get on with life．</div>
 <div>F．It is writing from your heart and mind and about the emotion associated with a certain event．</div>
 <div>G．Let your mind go to the detailed, specific moments to get to the feelings and truth of your experience．</div>

 <div>If you’ve spent any time on social media sites, you’ve probably noticed it: parents share news, photos, and other information about their children. This phenomenon is called “sharenting”, a combination of the words “sharing” and “parenting”.</div>
 <div>Much of the research on sharenting focuses on why parents choose to share online. Studies found that for parents of infants（婴儿），sharenting can help ease the social isolation that comes with this period in their children’s lives． Parents of teenagers also share information about their kids on social media. Research has shown their motivations include communicating their pride in their children’s accomplishments and informing friends and family about their</div>
 <div>kids’ lives.</div>
 <div>However, when parents post about their children on social media with high frequency, the phenomenon of “oversharenting” occurs, which can be a great cause for concern. For example, if parents share too much information that their children don’t want disclosed, it may lead them to with old information about their lives from their parents so they can better control what can and can’t be posted about them.</div>
 <div>Additionally, the cute photos or funny observations parents share online about their children could become a problem when their kids get older. In particular, colleges and employers are increasingly checking applicants’ online activity, and as a result, information posted by parents could become a source of embarrassment or affect a potential college’s or employer’s assessment of their child.</div>
 <div>Sharing information has never been faster than in the digital age. While it can be very convenient to post milestones of their children, it’s important for parents to ensure they’re sharing responsibly. After all, it’s not just a picture, it’s the child and their digital footprint.</div>

 <div>Dear Jim,</div>
 <div>I’m writing to invite you to join our school’s upcoming event themed “Traditional Chinese Medicine Culture”.</div>
 <div>Our school will be holding the event from 2 pm to 5 pm next Friday in the school lecture hall. During the event, experts will share the history of TCM as well as its use in modern healthcare. We can even have an opportunity to sample some traditional Chinese medical treatments, like herbal medicine and cupping. Sounds interesting, isn’t it?</div>
 <div>I’m sure this event will be as informative as it is fun. Would you like to come? I really hope you could make it to the event and experience the magic of TCM with us.</div>
 <div>Yours,</div>
