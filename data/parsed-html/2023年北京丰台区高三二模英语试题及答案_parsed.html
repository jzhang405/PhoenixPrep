 <div>Dave King is in his second winter of snowplowing（铲雪）people’s driveways for free.</div>
 <div>April Frazier is one person who has benefited from King’s kindness. She is a single mother. After one storm last year, she was busy looking after her kids and just knew she was not going to be able to get out there and <span class="math-inline "> <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="4.525ex" height="0.036ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 2000 16"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mstyle"><g data-mml-node="mspace"></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container></span> the snow.</div>
 <div>Frazier saw a post online in which King invited people to contact him if they needed help with that day’s storm. She <span class="math-inline "> <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="4.525ex" height="0.036ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 2000 16"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mstyle"><g data-mml-node="mspace"></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container></span> to him and offered to pay him, but he refused.</div>
 <div>Frazier was grateful-and has been <span class="math-inline "> <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="4.525ex" height="0.036ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 2000 16"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mstyle"><g data-mml-node="mspace"></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container></span> to see, with every storm since.

And one time, he <span class="math-inline "> <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="4.525ex" height="0.036ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 2000 16"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mstyle"><g data-mml-node="mspace"></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container></span> plowed her parents’ neighbors’ driveways without anyone asking him. &quot;He is loyal and <span class="math-inline "> <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="4.525ex" height="0.036ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 2000 16"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mstyle"><g data-mml-node="mspace"></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container></span> , &quot; said Frazier.</div>
 <div>King got the idea when he overheard a neighbor complaining she was having difficulty with the snow in her driveway. It occurred to King that he could plow the driveways of people in need for free.</div>
 <div>King went online and invited anyone who needed their driveways plowed to get in touch with him. People were <span class="math-inline "> <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="4.525ex" height="0.036ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 2000 16"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mstyle"><g data-mml-node="mspace"></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container></span> at first, as though he had some kind</div>
 <div>of dishonest plan going. But they were quick to find out he was 8 and started taking him up on his offer.</div>
 <div>King hopes to 9 this kindness and generosity and set up a whole network of volunteers to help people in need.</div>

 <div>Three years ago, I started a family and have experienced financial stress since then. I could pay my bills alright, but that was all I could do. I couldn’t even afford a family holiday.</div>

 <div>B</div>
 <div>When I was little, my dad would let me sit beside him on the porch while he painted. He would tell me how the cow by itself is just a cow, and the meadow by itself is just grass and flowers, and the sun peeking through the trees is just a beam of light, but put them all together and you’ve got magic.</div>
 <div>I understood what he was saying, but I’ve never felt what he was saying until one day when I was up in the sycamore tree to rescue a kite stuck in the branches.</div>
 <div>It was a long way up, but I thought I’d give it a shot. I started climbing. Then I looked down. And suddenly I got dizzy and weak. I was miles off the ground! But the kite was still beyond my reach. I caught my breath and forced myself to concentrate on the kite as I climbed up.</div>
 <div>When I had the kite free, I needed a minute to rest. That’s when the fear of being up so high began to lift, and in its place came the most amazing feeling that I was flying. Just soaring above the earth, sailing among the clouds.</div>
 <div>Then I began to notice how wonderful the breeze smelled. It seemed like sunshine and wild grass and rain! I couldn’t stop breathing it in, filling my lungs again and again with the sweetest smell I’d ever known.</div>
 <div>I never got over the view. I kept thinking of what it felt like to be up so high in that tree. I wanted to see it, to feel it, again. And again.</div>
 <div>It wasn’t long before I wasn’t afraid of being up so high and found the spot that became my spot. I could sit there for hours, just looking out at the world. Sunsets were amazing. Some days they’d be purple and pink, some days they’d be a blazing orange, setting fire to clouds across the horizon.</div>
 <div>It was on a day like that when my father’s notion (观念) moved from my head to my heart. The view from my sycamore was more than rooftops and clouds and wind and colors combined.</div>
 <div>And I started marveling (惊奇) at how I was feeling both humble and majestic. How was that possible? How could I be so full of peace and full of wonder?</div>
 <div>It was magic.</div>
 <ol start="24"> <li>Why did the author climb up the sycamore tree?</li> </ol> <div>A. To play in the tree.</div>
 <div>B. To get a trapped kite.</div>
 <div>C. To prove her courage.</div>
 <div>D. To practice climbing skills.</div>
 <ol start="25"> <li>The author’s climbing experience was</li> </ol> <div>A. unusual but painful</div>
 <div>B. competitive and imaginative</div>
 <div>C. adventurous but rewarding</div>
 <div>D. well-planned and interesting</div>
 <ol start="26"> <li>Why did the author like being up high in the tree?</li> </ol> <div>A. Because the tree had the sweetest smell.</div>
 <div>B. Because it could help her to concentrate.</div>
 <div>C. Because her father encouraged her to do so.</div>
 <div>D. Because she could enjoy more than good views.</div>
 <ol start="27"> <li>What message does the author want to convey?</li> </ol> <div>A. Practice makes perfect.</div>
 <div>B. Positive action leads to happiness.</div>
 <div>C. Beautiful things don’t ask for attention.</div>
 <div>D. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</div>
 <div>C</div>
 <div>Newspapers, advertisements, and labels surround us everywhere, turning our environment into a mass of texts to be read or ignored. As the quantity of information we receive continually increases and as information spreading is shifting from page to screen, it may be time to ask how changes in our way of reading may affect our mental life. For how we receive information bears vitally on the ways we experience and interpret reality.</div>
 <div>What is most obvious in the evolution of reading is the gradual displacement of the vertical(垂直的) by the horizontal-a shift from intensive to extensive reading. In our culture, access is not a problem, but proliferation(激增) is. And the reading act is necessarily different than it was in its earliest days. Awed by the availability of texts, the reader tends to move across surfaces without allowing the words to resonate(共鸣) inwardly.</div>
 <div>Interestingly, this shift from vertical to horizontal parallels the overall societal shift from bounded lifetimes spent in single locales to lives lived in wider geographical areas amid streams of data. This larger access was once regarded as worldliness-one traveled, knew the life of cities, the ways of diverse people…It has now become the birthright of anyone who owns a television set.</div>
 <div>How do we square the advantages and disadvantages of horizontal and vertical awareness? The villagers, who know everything about their surroundings, are</div>
 <div>blessedly unaware of events in distant lands. The media-obsessed urbanites, by contrast, never lose their awareness of what happens in different parts of the world.</div>
 <div>We may ask, which people are happier? The villagers may have found more sense in things owing both to the limited range of their concern and the depth of their information. But restricted conditions and habit also suggest boredom and limitation. The lack of a larger perspective(视角) leads to suspiciousness and cautious conservatism, but for the same reason, the constant availability of data and macro-perspectives has its own decreasing returns. When everything is happening everywhere, it gets harder to care about anything.</div>
 <div>How do we assign value? Where do we find the fixed context that allows us to create a narrative of sense about our lives? Ideally, I suppose, one would have the best of both worlds-the purposeful fixity of the local, as well as the availability of enhancing views: a natural ecology of information and context.</div>
 <ol start="28"> <li>What can we learn about the first two paragraphs?</li> </ol> <div>A. Readers today tend to ignore deep engagement with texts.</div>
 <div>B. It’s difficult to shift from vertical to horizontal reading.</div>

 <div>D. Horizontal reading affects our mindset more than vertical reading.</div>
 <div>D</div>
 <div>Coastal cities worldwide are squeezed by two opposing forces: urban sprawl(扩张) and the rising sea. This struggle is intensely visible in the flatlands where expanding neighborhoods routinely flood and saltwater flooding damages</div>
 <div>the river mouths that protect communities from the worst of our climate crisis.</div>
 <div>Massive resources are being put into environmental restoration projects, and development is subject to many layers of approvals. Yet in 2022 the commissioners of a coastal city voted to expand a legal boundary that contains sprawl to allow a 400-acre warehouse project. They are failing to see the value of this land in the greater ecosystem.</div>
 <div>Wetlands, coastal plains and forests do cheaply (or even for free) what seawalls and pumps do at a cost of billions of dollars. They are vital infrastructure(基础设施) that makes us more resilient against climate change, and the cost of destroying them or weakening their ability to function must be factored into the decisions we make to build and grow.</div>
 <div>To do so, the economic incentives to develop any natural landscape should be weighed against the protective economic value that land already provides. Economists call this an “avoided damage” valuation. Local planning boards might consider the value of a sand dune or swamp in flood protection versus the expense of replacing it with a seawall and water pump system. Maintaining and restoring natural infrastructure to support healthy functioning saves money, time and lives.</div>
 <div>The concept of “natural capital”, or the idea that ecosystem services should be valued in a similar manner as any form of wealth, dates back to the 1970s. Markets have always valued wood as a commodity(商品), for example, but not the services that came along with producing it, such as soil maintenance, carbon storage, and nutrient cycling. We didn’t need a market for resources that industrialists saw as abundant(丰富的) and endlessly renewable. This exploitative(开发资源的) assumption turned out to be very wrong. Failing to measure the benefits of ecosystem services in policy and management decisions is a major reason many of those ecosystems disappeared.</div>
 <div>It also seems crass to place a dollar amount on ecosystems that we’d rather view as priceless, existing for their own sake and valuable to humans in ways that are beyond capitalism. This preciousness is ethically sound. But developers have long confused pricelessness with worthlessness, allowing them to profit without paying for the consequences of destroying the environment.</div>
 <div>Economic value is never the only reason nature is worth preserving; it is simply a powerful, underused tool to help us make decisions about how to live more sustainably in a climate-changed world. If policy makers considered natural</div>
 <div>are not.</div>
 <div>Being open-minded to other people’s beliefs and new things is great, but it does not mean that you are actually learning anything. Furthermore, there is no way to ever have a truly complete growth mindset. 37 . It is important that you accept this and embrace it, while still desiring to experience growth anyway.

 <div>Brain, 58, was treated in intensive care for a severe case. As soon as his condition had stabilized, he was sent home with equipment including a phone and a blood pressure monitor.</div>
 <div>“Every day I would input my vital signs on the app,” Brain said. &quot;If anything</div>
 <div>went wrong or wasn’t right, a nurse would call me straight away.&quot;</div>
 <div>Brain spent six weeks on this “virtual ward(病房)”, run by his local NHS hospital in partnership with Doccla, a healthcare technology company. He is one of thousands of patients to have been treated in new “hospitals at home”, seen by NHS leaders as a “lifeline” for overwhelmed hospitals that have run out of beds. 2,500 virtual ward beds were already in use, ensuring that people could “get the care they need from their own homes”.</div>
 <ul> <li>Retz, founder of Docile, said soon there could be “regional command centers”, where a doctor or nurse monitored data from hundreds of patients displayed on a dashboard. “It works in a similar way to traditional ward rounds in a hospital, with patients submitting data once or twice a day, which is reviewed by a doctor,” he said.</li> </ul> <div>Noel O’Kelly, clinical director at Spirit Health, said, “Older people want to spend as little time in hospital as possible and avoid hospital visits, particularly as frequent visits and long periods of time spent in hospital can be damaging to the health of older patients. We have already seen very encouraging results from the use of virtual wards for older patients.”</div>
 <div>Virtual wards allow real potential to support people to recover well in the community. The model is not a silver bullet and health leaders are mindful that it should not worsen health inequalities, but it could present a vital lifeline for the system.</div>

 <div>Dear Jim,</div>
 <div>How is everything going? I’d like to share with you my plans for the upcoming summer vacation.</div>
 <div>First, I’m going to take a trip with my parents. It’s a great way to unwind and recharge after a year of hard work. Moreover, we can explore breathtaking scenery and spend quality time together during the journey.</div>
 <div>Learning some new skills is also on my agenda. Passionate about programming, I’m planning to attend relevant online courses to take my programming skills to the next level, which will be beneficial for my future major.</div>
 <div>I just can’t wait to kick off my summer vacation! Have you got any vacation plans yet? Looking forward to your reply.</div>
 <div>Yours,</div>
