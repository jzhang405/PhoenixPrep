 <div>Before Jenny passed away from cancer, she made her husband, Steve, and their daughter, Brittany, promise her one thing: he would 1 Brittany, a high school senior, to the homecoming (返校节) game, where she was 2 for homecoming queen. It was important to her that her daughter should go. Brittany and Steve 3.</div>
 <div>Days later, on the morning of Friday, September 24, Jenny died. Keeping their 4, that very afternoon, an emotional Brittany walked arm in arm with her father across the football field with the other nominees (被提名者) to await the 5 of the voting.</div>
 <div>Brittany wasn’t named homecoming queen that day; Nyla was. But, like many in the close-knit community, Nyla had heard about Jenny and her noble deeds for the community. In a(n) 6 gesture, moments after receiving the crown, Nyla walked over to Brittany, removed the crown from her head, and placed it atop her friend’s. The two embraced, 7 holding each other tightly for support.</div>
 <div>“She’d rather have her mom than a crown,” Nyla said. By handing it to Brittany, “I was telling her that she was her mom’s queen, and that she was loved by many, especially me.”</div>
 <div>“I felt so much love from her, and I just felt so much love for her,” said Brittany, who paid Nyla the ultimate praise, “I can see my mom through Nyla. They have the same caring, 8 spirit.”</div>
 <div>“Nyla is no less queen for lack of a crown,” said a teacher. There’s a saying that real queens 9 each other’s crowns. But the truth is, real queens give up their crowns to let other queens 10.</div>

 <div>“Conventional wisdom tells us that we can feel happier if we smile or that we can get ourselves 14 a more serious mood if we scowl (怒视),” said Nicholas Coles, a PhD at Utah University. His team combined data from 138 studies testing more than 11,000 participants and found facial 15 (express) do have impact on feelings. For example, smiling makes people happier, scowling makes them feel angrier, and frowning makes them 16 (sad). These findings are exciting because they provide a clue about how the mind and body interact 17 (influence) our conscious experience of emotion.</div>

There are a dozen steps, from grinding tea for fine powder, to pouring boiled water, stirring the mixture for thick froth (泡沫), and finally drawing patterns. Clear water is used to put into the cup. When the water 19 (touch) the surface of tea, it turns into a white color and disappears in 20 minutes. The process before drawing is known as “diancha”. The quality of it is crucial to 20 the patterns can be successfully produced later.</div>

 <div>“I can’t connect with your characters.”</div>
 <div>I kept hearing the same feedback and was unable to understand why and not sure what to do. I was a character-driven writer. How could I mess up the one thing I was supposed to be good at? I was determined to convince my agent that these characters were real. After all, I knew they were real. My main character Lotus had lived inside me for years. I just needed to clarify her on the page.</div>
 <div>I wrote and edited for a year, trying to respond to this agent’s feedback. But Lotus’ personality began to disappear. I tried to have her make “better” decisions, wear smarter fashion, and have more friends, as my agent said she acted “immature” and was “isolated”. And when this agent ultimately parted ways with me, I felt like I had failed. Now with time and distance, I realize I tried to fit Lotus into a neurotypical style to please my agent. And as a result, Lotus lost her Lotus-ness.</div>
 <div>When that agent discouraged me from writing Lotus as autistic (自闭的), he said that would make Lotus seem more “vulnerable (脆弱的)” or an “obvious victim”. I didn’t want Lotus to seem vulnerable. Lotus’ autism is what makes her powerful, I tried to explain. But from a neurotypical perspective, Lotus’ autism could only be seen as a weakness.</div>
 <div>Unsure of how to convince my agent of the strength and power autistic women hold, I began to write Lotus as “neurotypical”. And I failed miserably. After all, what do I know about being neurotypical? My whole life, autism was my default. Not being diagnosed until 2020, I assumed the way I saw the world was “normal”.</div>
 <div>My current agent encourages me to write from my neurodivergent (神经多样性的) experience. With this invitation, I revisited Lotus and saw her the way I first wrote her. And when I did, the characters and the entire narrative began to make more sense.</div>
 <div>Identifying my characters as neurodivergent not only gives me joy as a writer, but it has produced my strongest writing. For so long, I’ve combatted the advice to “write what I know”, in part because I didn’t know what I actually knew. I didn’t know I was neurodivergent. But as I mine the specificity of my lived experience, my writing is stronger. There is a power to our lived experience. It’s not a limitation on our craft, but a swinging open of the gates.</div>

 <div>To a chef, the sounds of lip smacking, slurping and swallowing are the highest form of flattery (恭维). But to someone with a certain type of misophonia (恐音症), these same sounds can be torturous. Brain scans are now helping scientists start to understand why.</div>
 <div>People with misophonia experience strong discomfort, annoyance or disgust when they hear particular triggers. These can include chewing, swallowing, slurping, throat clearing, coughing and even audible breathing. Researchers previously thought this reaction might be caused by the brain overactively processing certain sounds. Now, however, a new study published in Journal of Neuroscience has linked some forms of misophonia to heightened “mirroring” behavior in the brain: those affected feel distress while their brains act as if they were imitating the triggering mouth movements.</div>
 <div>“This is the first breakthrough in misophonia research in 25 years,” says psychologist Jennifer J. Brout, who directs the International Misophonia Research Network and was not involved in the new study.</div>
 <div>The research team, led by Newcastle University neuroscientist Sukhbinder Kumar, analyzed brain activity in people with and without misophonia when they were at rest and while they listened to sounds. These included misophonia triggers (such as chewing), generally unpleasant sounds (like a crying baby), and neutral sounds. The brain’s auditory (听觉的) cortex, which processes sound, reacted similarly in subjects with and without misophonia. But in both the resting state and listening trials, people with misophonia showed stronger connections between the auditory cortex and brain regions that control movements of the face, mouth and throat, while the controlled group didn’t. Kumar found this connection became most active in participants with misophonia when they heard triggers specific to the condition.</div>
 <div>“Just by listening to the sound, they activate the motor cortex more strongly. So in a way it was as if they were doing the action themselves,” Kumar says. Some mirroring is typical in most humans when witnessing others’ actions; the researchers do not yet know why an excessive（过分的）mirroring response might cause such a negative reaction, and hope to address that in future research. “Possibilities include a sense of loss of control, invasion of personal space, or interference with current goals and actions,” the study authors write.</div>
 <div>Fatima Husain, an Illinois University professor of speech and hearing science, who was not involved in the study, says potential misophonia therapies could build on the new findings by counseling patients about handling unconscious motor responses to triggering sounds - not just coping with the sounds themselves. If this works, she adds, one should expect to see reduced connected activity between the auditory and motor cortices.</div>

 <div>At a museum in Vietnam, Lena Bui’s film Where Birds Dance Their Last reflected on the beauty and vulnerability of Vietnamese feather farms after Bird Flu. During a festival in Rwanda, Ellen Reid’s audio experience Soundwalk was shared in a hopeful discussion about music, parks and mental health. These are a few of the things I have helped bring to life over the years, working at the intersection of scientific research, the arts and advocacy to support science in solving global health challenges.</div>
 <div>Science is key to addressing these issues. But it isn’t the only key. To achieve its potential and for</div>
 <div>its advances to be implemented and reach all who could benefit, science depends on trust and good relationships. People might not always see science as relevant, trustworthy or meaningful to their lives. There are reasons why some see science as having a chequered past, from nuclear weapons to eugenics (优生学), and are therefore uninterested in, or suspicious of, what it proposes. Others feel excluded by the incomprehensibility of hyperspecialist knowledge.</div>
 <div>In its capacity to build upon and test an evidence base, science is powerful, but researchers and funders haven’t been as good at ensuring this evidence base responds to the needs and interests of diverse communities, or informs policy makers to take action. Science might be perceived as distancing itself from the personal, the poetic and the political, yet it is precisely these qualities that can be most influential when it comes to public interest in a topic or how a government prioritizes a decision.</div>
 <div>A moving story well told can be more memorable than a list of facts. This is where the arts come in. Artists can give us different perspectives with which to consider and reimagine the world together. They can redress the proclaimed objectivity in science by bringing stories - subjectivities - into the picture, and these can help foster a sense of connection and hope.</div>
 <div>In 2012, I set up artist residencies in medical research centres around the world. Bui was attached to the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Vietnam. The head of the research team was delighted, finding that Bui, as a Vietnamese artist, had license to be in, and to share useful insights from, villages where infectious disease researchers weren’t welcome. Six years later, I led Wellcome’s Contagious Cities program, which established artist residencies worldwide to support locally led explorations of epidemic preparedness. The recent pandemic made this work more noticeable, and has informed our Mindscapes program which is currently sharing experiences of mental health through the work of artists.</div>
 <div>With pandemic, climate and mental health crises upon us, rising inequality and what feels like an increasingly broken world, never has there been more need to build and nurture hopeful and imaginative spaces to grow human connection and shared purpose for the common good. Science and the arts can work hand in glove to achieve this.</div>

 <div>“Just think positively!”</div>
 <div>“It could be worse.”</div>
 <div>“You should look at the bright side!”</div>
 <div>We’ve all heard (and maybe used) these phrases without much thought. But they could be contributing to a culture of toxic (有毒的) positivity. For those new to this term, it might sound like an oxymoron (矛盾修辞法). How can positivity be toxic? Isn’t it supposed to be helpful, or “positive”, as the name suggests? <span class="math-inline "> <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="4.525ex" height="0.036ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 2000 16"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mstyle"><g data-mml-node="mspace"></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container></span></div>
 <div>“Toxic positivity is when somebody avoids all negative thoughts or feelings, pretending everything is going well when it is not,” explains Melissa Dowd, a therapist at PlushCare, a virtual health platform for primary care and mental health services. Whitney Goodman, the author of Toxic Positivity describes toxic positivity as the “endless pressure to be happy and positive, no matter what the circumstances are.” <span class="math-inline "> <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="4.525ex" height="0.036ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 2000 16"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mstyle"><g data-mml-node="mspace"></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container></span> It’s also something we can cause other people to experience.</div>
 <div>Expressing toxic positivity to others may look like offering them a simple solution to a complicated problem that we know nothing about, or not allowing people around you to appropriately express negative emotions.</div>
 <div>Toxic positivity causes us to suppress our emotions, which can make them worse. 37 “Although it can be helpful to look on the bright side when facing challenges,” Dowd says, “not coping with negative feelings in a healthy way in the moment can lead to those feelings resurfacing later in different areas of your life or as a form of anxiety.” <span class="math-inline "> <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG"><svg style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="4.525ex" height="0.036ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 2000 16"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mstyle"><g data-mml-node="mspace"></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container></span> “If I feel like you’re going to dismiss me, I’m going to stop sharing how I’m feeling,” Goodman adds.</div>
 <div>39 If you’re using toxic positivity against yourself, Goodman suggests remembering it’s OK if you’re upset about something. It’s valid if something annoys you. “Allow ourselves and other people to share when they’re going through a difficult time,” she says. Dowd adds that it’s essential that “we all learn to cope with and process our emotions in a healthy way as opposed to avoiding how we feel” as life’s stressors continue to rise. For example, instead of simply saying “Just think positively,” we’d better say “Sometimes bad things happen. How can I help?”</div>
 <div>A. Are there ways to avoid toxic positivity?</div>
 <div>B. Toxic positivity also disrupts connection.</div>
 <div>C. It can harm people who are going through difficult times.</div>
 <div>D. This can come up in different situations when we are dealing with pressure.</div>
 <div>E. They become more intense and can cause long-lasting health concerns in the future.</div>
 <div>F. Experts say constant forced positivity can lead to the opposite, and have a negative effect.</div>
 <div>G. This is what we may bring on to ourselves by not allowing negative thoughts and feelings.</div>

 <div>E-waste is a serious problem that isn’t going to get better on its own. Here are some do-it-yourself tips on how to manage e-waste.</div>
 <div>Maybe the biggest cause of our e-waste problem is the fact that we buy things that we just don’t need. Next time you feel like you need a device or electronic item, stop yourself and ask if it is truly necessary. This is maybe also the easiest way we can manage e-waste. Organize your electronics. If you don’t keep your connectors, DVDs, wires and gadgets organized, you won’t be aware of what you have. When we buy duplicate electronics because we think we need them, we are contributing to our growing e-waste problem. “How to manage e-waste” becomes less of an issue when we keep our own houses in order.</div>
 <div>If you do not need a piece of equipment and it is in good enough condition to be reused, donate it as soon as you can so that somebody else can use it. Donations are good for us because they are a useful way to get tax deductions (减税), and a lot of times that tax deduction will be close to the value of the item had you tried to sell it. Take your electronics back to the store. Some stores offer trade-in programs, where you can drop off your old equipment in return for gift cards.</div>
 <div>There are also places to sell electronics that might be valuable to somebody else. Just be sure to sell</div>
 <div>them right away, because they lose value very rapidly in our changing market.</div>
 <div>If you are frequently receiving memory sticks and little gadgets, collect them into a good-e-bag. Whenever you no longer need a USB stick or a small electronic device, toss it into the bag. You might be surprised at how quickly it fills up. So be sure you are utilizing your materials and products thoughtfully. With these tips you can use DIY solutions to learn how to manage e-waste. Your house will be cleaner, you will save money and you’ll be doing a good thing.</div>
 <ol start="40"> <li> <div>What is the biggest cause of our e-waste problem?</div>
 </li> <li> <div>How can people get tax deductions when managing e-waste?</div>
 </li> </ol> <div>42.- Please decide which part is false in the following statement, then underline it and explain why. Sell the electronics that you don’t need right away because the earlier you sell them, the more gift cards you can get.</div>
