# Feature Specification: Test Paper Import Interface

**Feature Branch**: `002-pdf`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "我们需要一个试卷录入接口，用于将收集到的各类试卷资源（PDF、WORD、图片等）解析并存储到系统知识库中。"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content administrator, I want to import test papers from various file formats (PDF, WORD, images) so that the system can parse and store them in the knowledge base for student use.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a PDF test paper file, **When** they upload it through the import interface, **Then** the system should parse the content and store it in the knowledge base
2. **Given** a user has multiple image files of test papers, **When** they upload them through the import interface, **Then** the system should process each image and store the extracted content
3. **Given** a user attempts to upload an unsupported file format, **When** they submit the file, **Then** the system should reject the upload and provide clear error messaging
4. **Given** a user uploads a test paper, **When** the parsing process completes, **Then** the system should provide confirmation of successful storage in the knowledge base

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a PDF file is password-protected or corrupted?
- How does the system handle poor quality images where text extraction is difficult?
- What happens when the system encounters mathematical formulas or diagrams in the test papers?
- How does the system handle duplicate test papers being uploaded?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an interface for uploading test paper files in PDF, WORD, and image formats
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse the content of uploaded test papers to extract text, questions, and structure
- **FR-003**: System MUST store parsed test paper content in the knowledge base with appropriate metadata
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate file formats and reject unsupported types
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide feedback on the import process status and results
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle multiple file uploads in a single import operation
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain the integrity and structure of the original test paper content during parsing

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Paper Import**: Represents the process of uploading and parsing external test paper files
- **File Upload**: Represents individual file submissions with metadata about format, size, and processing status
- **Parsed Content**: Represents the extracted and structured information from test papers ready for knowledge base storage
