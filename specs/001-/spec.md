# Feature Specification: Personalized Learning System for High School Repeat Students

**Feature Branch**: `001-`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "我们需要构建一个面向高考复读生的个性化学习系统，该系统需实现以下核心功能：能够完整存储包含文字、图片、表格、公式等多元媒体的试题资源；支持基于知识点、难度、年份等多维度的智能检索与精准组卷；通过分析学生的答题记录，动态评估各知识点掌握程度并识别薄弱环节；基于知识点分值权重预测高考得分；提供可视化的学习进度跟踪和能力发展趋势分析；根据评估结果智能推荐个性化练习内容和复习重点。"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a high school repeat student preparing for the college entrance exam, I want to use a personalized learning system that analyzes my performance across different knowledge points, identifies my weak areas, and recommends targeted practice materials so that I can efficiently improve my exam scores.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a student has completed several practice tests, **When** the system analyzes their performance data, **Then** it should identify specific knowledge points where the student is struggling
2. **Given** a student wants to practice specific knowledge points, **When** they request practice materials, **Then** the system should generate personalized exercises based on their proficiency level
3. **Given** a student has been using the system for multiple study sessions, **When** they view their progress dashboard, **Then** they should see visual representations of their improvement trends and predicted exam scores
4. **Given** a teacher wants to create a practice test, **When** they specify criteria like knowledge points and difficulty levels, **Then** the system should generate a customized test paper

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a student has no previous performance data?
- How does the system handle questions with multiple media types (text, images, tables, formulas)?
- What happens when the system cannot find enough questions matching specific criteria?
- How does the system handle conflicting or incomplete knowledge point data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST store and manage question resources containing text, images, tables, and mathematical formulas
- **FR-002**: System MUST support intelligent search and filtering of questions based on knowledge points, difficulty levels, and year of origin
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically generate customized test papers based on specified criteria
- **FR-004**: System MUST analyze student answer records to dynamically assess mastery levels of individual knowledge points
- **FR-005**: System MUST identify weak areas and knowledge gaps based on performance analysis
- **FR-006**: System MUST predict college entrance exam scores based on knowledge point weightings and student proficiency
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide visual tracking of learning progress and ability development trends
- **FR-008**: System MUST recommend personalized practice content and review priorities based on assessment results
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain historical performance data for trend analysis
- **FR-010**: System MUST support multiple question types and formats within the same resource library

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Question Resource**: Represents individual test questions with content, media attachments, knowledge point associations, difficulty rating, and metadata
- **Knowledge Point**: Represents specific curriculum concepts that questions are categorized under, with weightings for exam scoring
- **Student Profile**: Represents individual student data including performance history, identified weak areas, and learning progress
- **Test Paper**: Represents customized collections of questions generated based on specific criteria
- **Performance Analysis**: Represents the assessment results and insights derived from student answer patterns
